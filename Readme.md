# Description for changes

Avoid repeating yourself, use pry-rails instead of copying the initializer to every rails project.
This is a small gem which causes `rails console` to open [pry](http://pry.github.com/). It therefore depends on *pry*.

1: Command "show-model ModelName" or "show-model ModelName true" gives all columns and associations.
2: Command "show-model ModelName false" gives associations only.
